## 1. Nombre del Proyecto

**Acme DevKit**

[[Confianza: Alta]]

## 2. Elevator Pitch

Acme DevKit helps small engineering teams eliminate 40-60% code duplication and reduce project setup from weeks to hours through a centralized code system with automated project generation.

[[Confianza: Alta]]

## 3. Problema que Resuelve

Engineering teams waste days or weeks on repetitive setup work while independently reimplementing the same features—authentication, forms, common features—across every new project. This creates a maintenance nightmare where 40-60% of code is duplicated, new developers need 2-4 weeks to become productive, and security vulnerabilities must be fixed multiple times across different software projects. Current project setup time has not been formally measured, making the problem's full scope difficult to quantify.

## 4. Para Quién Es

- **Primary audience:** Small internal development teams (5-15 web developers) building web applications who need standardized tooling without enterprise-level complexity
- **Secondary audience:** Product teams requiring rapid application scaffolding and new engineers joining the organization
- **Specific contexts:** Creating new customer-facing applications, consolidating existing component libraries, onboarding developers, maintaining consistent brand identity across products

## 5. Propuesta de Valor

- **Eliminate duplicate work:** Reduce 40-60% code duplication across projects through centralized, numbered code modules, cutting maintenance burden in half
- **Accelerate time-to-market:** Transform project setup from unmeasured weeks to under one day using pre-configured automated scaffolding
- **Faster team scaling:** Reduce new developer onboarding from 2-4 weeks to under 3 days with clear standards and working examples
- **Maintain consistent customer experience:** Every product looks and feels like the same brand family through unified design standards

## 6. Características Principales

- **Generate production-ready projects rapidly** (typically under a day, with simple projects in under an hour) using automated setup commands that create applications with login, navigation, and brand styling already working
- **Eliminate inconsistent user interfaces across products** by unifying all teams around the same proven components from the existing library
- **Keep all products visually aligned with brand standards automatically** when designers update colors, fonts, or spacing in the design software (Token Studio)
- **Catch code quality issues before they reach production**, reducing bugs and security vulnerabilities through pre-configured standards
- **Deploy with confidence** using standardized automated deployment templates optimized for small team workflows
- **Onboard developers rapidly** with comprehensive component documentation and working example applications demonstrating proven patterns

## 7. Casos de Uso

**New Project Launch:** A product manager needs a customer dashboard by month-end. A developer uses Acme DevKit to create the application in under an hour with login, the company design system, and deployment automation already working—eliminating two weeks of typical setup work.

**Security Vulnerability Fix:** The security team discovers an authentication vulnerability. Instead of manually patching five separate implementations across different projects, they fix the centralized login module once, and all consuming applications receive the update through a single package upgrade.

**Designer Workflow Integration:** A designer updates brand colors in the design tool. The automated pipeline transforms these brand elements and publishes updates. All applications automatically receive the updated theme through the automatic update mechanism, maintaining brand consistency without manual updates.

## 8. Diferenciadores

- **Builds on existing assets vs. starting from scratch:** Consolidates the proven component library and design system rather than forcing teams to adopt unfamiliar tools
- **Purpose-built for small teams:** Focuses on high-value patterns without the overwhelming complexity of enterprise-scale tools
- **Specialized for your exact technology stack:** Delivers faster setup and fewer compatibility issues than generic solutions that spread thin across multiple technologies

## 9. Modelo de Valor

Internal platform investment with return on investment (ROI) measured through productivity gains and cost avoidance. By eliminating 40-60% code duplication, the framework prevents hundreds of hours of duplicate maintenance annually across teams. Reducing onboarding from 2-4 weeks to under 3 days accelerates time-to-productivity for new hires. Faster project setup (weeks to under 1 day) enables quicker market response and reduced opportunity costs.

**Investment requirement:** One senior software architect for 3-4 months to build minimum viable product (MVP), with potential team expansion once metrics prove value.

## 10. Éxito Medible

- **Code duplication reduction:** From 40-60% baseline to under 30% within 6 months post-adoption
- **Project setup time:** Establish current baseline (currently unmeasured), then achieve under 1 day for production deployment once baseline is established
- **Developer onboarding velocity:** From 2-4 weeks to under 3 days for first production contribution
- **Adoption rate:** 80%+ of new projects using Acme DevKit within 6 months
- **Developer satisfaction:** Satisfaction rating (Net Promoter Score) of 8+/10 measured quarterly

## 11. Riesgos y Mitigación

- **Riesgo: Over-engineering before validation** — Building comprehensive features before proving core value could waste resources on unused capabilities  
  **Mitigación:** Strict MVP scope limited to 3-5 packages (design elements, component library, configs), expand only after measuring adoption and satisfaction

- **Riesgo: Grassroots initiative without executive sponsorship** — Project could be deprioritized if business priorities shift  
  **Mitigación:** Build compelling business case with duplicate code metrics and onboarding improvements, secure CTO/VP Engineering sponsorship before Phase 2 expansion

- **Riesgo: Adoption resistance from autonomous teams** — Developers accustomed to freedom may resist framework-mandated patterns  
  **Mitigación:** Make framework opt-in initially, demonstrate value through pilot project, gather feedback before mandating organization-wide adoption

## 12. Siguientes Pasos

1. **Establish measurement baselines** — Time 2-3 developers creating projects from scratch to quantify current setup duration and validate improvement targets — Week 1
2. **Choose code management tool** — Evaluate options using decision matrix (build speed, learning curve, small team ergonomics), commit to one tool — Week 1-2
3. **Build business case for sponsorship** — Compile duplicate code metrics, onboarding baseline, and projected ROI; present to CTO/VP Engineering for formal approval — Week 2
4. **Extract MVP packages** — Consolidate existing component library and formalize design tool export into 3 core packages — Week 2-7
5. **Run internal pilot** — Have one team build real project using Acme DevKit, measure results, gather feedback — Week 9-10

## 13. Llamado a la Acción

To eliminate weeks of duplicate work and accelerate engineering productivity, let's review the business case and baseline metrics in a 30-minute executive briefing.

**[[NOTA CRÍTICA: Baseline Measurement Required]]**  
Time-to-deploy baseline is currently unmeasured. Before proceeding with executive presentation, conduct timing exercise with 2-3 developers to establish concrete "before" metrics. This data is essential for ROI justification and securing formal sponsorship.
